Create command line tool named "progress" using the rust programming language. It should read stdin and copy it to stdout. While data is passing through 
the tool, the tool should keep track of number of bytes copied, time in seconds since first byte arrived and average speed (bytes per second). Once a 
second the tool should print to stderr the number of bytes, time since first byte and average speed. The stderr print should end with carriage return 
instead of newline. When stdin closes, the program should print one newline to stderr and exit. Test the program builds and works.
